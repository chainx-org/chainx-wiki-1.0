## Map DOT to SDOT on ChainX

Anyone who participated in the Polkadot ICO in 2017 can map the current untransferrable DOT to SDOT on ChainX in 1:1, enjoying the benefits of deposits mining in ChainX permanently. [View the list of all qualified ETH addresses](https://etherscan.io/token/tokenholderchart/0xb59f67a8bff5d8cd03f6ac17265c550ed8f33907). The mapped SDOT can participate in the assets mining of ChainX until Polkadot's launch. After that, all SDOT will be destoried accordingly. It's sort of airdrop for the DOT investors actually.

1. Create a ChainX account if you don't have one at https://wallet.chainx.org.

3. Then you'll see a popup prompting you to choose an optional channel which is some intention in ChainX. 10% cross-chain mapping reward will be issued to your channel. If you choose to skip, the council will receive this 10% reward instead.

4. You need to send a transaction from the address with DOT token to any ETH address(**yourself is recommended**) with any value(**0 is recommended**), filling the following information in the `Data` field:

5. Copy and paste the transaction ID(Txid/TxHash) you sent in the last step bellow. SDOT will be issued to your mapped ChainX address immediately once the transaction signature is validated successfully.

6. Now your mapped SDOT is able to earn PCX! However, you're still having an issue: how to get the transaction fee of claiming the reward? There are two ways:

    - find someone to send you a few PCX.

    - deposit BTC. The PCX earned by the deposits mining during the BTC confirmation period will be issued your ChainX account automatically
